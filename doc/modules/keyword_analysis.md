2. Interpreting the Graph
    * The graph uses keywords analyzed from the DOAJ to represent the frequency of keywords with respect time.
    * The legend below the graph indicates which line connects to which keyword.
    * The x-axis represents time; while the y-axis measures the frequency, number of times on average the indicated word appears in a paper.
